# ECDLR Kiosk Scripts
Python script that formats kiosk sign ins to be merged easily with written sign-ins for El Centro de la Raza for the current version of the kiosk survey and another that extracts emails of students who want to join the listserv as of 3.01.2019 a. 


# How to use
Make a copy of the current kiosk sign-ins and ensure that python is installed on your computer. 

Open your terminal and type py csvFormatter.py and the prompt will appear to enter the file name. The file must be in the same directory as csvFormatter.py, a list of the files will be shown to verify the file you want to be formatted is in the current directory.
After it is done formatting, check the new directory named "KioskSignInsFormatted" to find your formatted csv file

The same process to the Listserv.py script. A new txt file will appear in the directory containing the emails of students who would want to join the listserv
