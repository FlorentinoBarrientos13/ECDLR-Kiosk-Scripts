# ECDLR Kiosk Scripts
Python script that formats kiosk sign ins to be merged easily with written sign-ins for El Centro de la Raza. Contains two files, csvFormatter.py, the file that formats the kiosk sign-ins, and ListServ.py, the file that gathers the students who want to join the El Centro de la Raza listserv. 


# How to use
Make a copy of the current kiosk sign-ins and ensure that python is installed on your computer. 

Open your terminal and type py csvFormatter.py, (if you have python already installed then double click on the file) and the prompt will appear that will tell you to enter the file name for the kiosk sign ins. The file must be in the same directory as csvFormatter.py. A list of the files that are in the current folder will be shown. If the file that you want to format is not in the list, please ensure that both the csvFormatter.py and the kiosk sign in file are in the same folder.
After it is done formatting, a new folder named "KioskSignInsFormatted" will be created containing the formatted version of the kiosk sign ins.

The same process to the Listserv.py script. A new .txt file will appear in the directory containing the emails of students who would want to join the listserv.
